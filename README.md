# Smart Indoor Hydroponic Farming

![Project Logo](/src/logo.png)

This project was developed as part of an integrated engineering team project. It involves the implementation of a smart indoor hydroponic farming system with an Arduino-based control system and a web-based admin dashboard.

## Project Overview

The Smart Indoor Hydroponic Farming system aims to provide an automated solution for indoor farming, allowing users to grow plants efficiently using hydroponic techniques. The system includes the following components:

- Arduino-based control system for monitoring and controlling environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, pH levels, and nutrient levels.
- Web-based admin dashboard for users to remotely monitor the status of the hydroponic system, adjust settings, and receive notifications.
