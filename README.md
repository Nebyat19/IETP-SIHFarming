# Smart Indoor Hydroponic Farming

![Project Logo](/src/logo.png)

This project was developed as part of an integrated engineering team project. It involves the implementation of a smart indoor hydroponic farming system with an Arduino-based control system and a web-based admin dashboard.

## Project Overview

The Smart Indoor Hydroponic Farming system aims to provide an automated solution for indoor farming, allowing users to grow plants efficiently using hydroponic techniques. The system includes the following components:

- Arduino-based control system for monitoring and controlling environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, pH levels, and nutrient levels.
- Web-based admin dashboard for users to remotely monitor the status of the hydroponic system, adjust settings, and receive notifications.
## Features

- Automated monitoring and control of environmental parameters.
- Web-based admin dashboard for real-time monitoring and management.
- Integration of sensors and actuators for optimal plant growth.
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation and control.

## Arduino Code

The Arduino code for controlling the hydroponic system can be found as `/controllerCode.h` . It include sketches for reading sensor data, controlling actuators, and implementing automated routines.

## Web-Based Admin Dashboard

The web-based admin dashboard for monitoring and managing the hydroponic system can be found in the `dashboard` directory. It provides a user-friendly interface for viewing real-time data, adjusting settings, and controlling the system remotely.
